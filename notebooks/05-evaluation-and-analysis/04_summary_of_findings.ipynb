    "# Summary of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Political, Gender, and Age Bias Dominate Coverage**\n",
    "These three dimensions consistently appear as the most frequent, highest-scoring, and most persistent bias types across all analyses—from keyword frequency to co-occurrence matrices to temporal trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Coverage is Heavily Skewed Toward Hard News and Sports**\n",
    "Politics and sports dominate article volume, while social issues, environment, health, and education are significantly underrepresented, creating a structural imbalance in topic coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Implicit Bias Concentrates on Specific Groups with Negative Stereotypes**\n",
    "The most frequent implicit bias patterns target elderly, Muslims, Dalits, and the poor with deficit framing (e.g., \"Elderly Weak,\" \"Muslim Violence,\" \"Dalit Poor\"), while positive framings are rare.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Men and Authority Figures Dominate Representation**\n",
    "Male mentions outnumber female mentions ~3:1, decision-makers appear ~4× more than victims, and authority sources vastly outweigh expert voices—indicating systemic visibility gaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Bias Dimensions Are Largely Independent, Not Correlated**\n",
    "Different bias types (political, gender, caste, religion, etc.) tend to appear separately rather than together, with near-zero correlations between most dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Most Articles Show Moderate Overall Bias (~0.54 mean)**\n",
    "Bias is generally present but rarely extreme—the distribution centers around moderate scores, with few articles at very low or very high bias levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Recency Bias Exists in the Dataset**\n",
    "Recent years contribute disproportionately more articles, and bias levels have increased since ~2013, particularly in regional, socioeconomic, and urban-rural dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Sentiment Skews Positive, but Fear Dominates Emotional Framing**\n",
    "While overall sentiment classification leans positive, fear is the most common dominant emotion when emotion words are present, followed by joy.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Religion, Gender, and Socioeconomic Status Have Highest Stereotype Density**\n",
    "When these dimensions are referenced, they are most likely to contain stereotype-related language, even if they don't appear in the highest volume of articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Framing is Polarized, Not Neutral**\n",
    "For specific groups (Muslims, women, poor, Dalits), articles cluster around clearly positive or clearly negative framing scores—neutral coverage is rare, and the poor face the most negative framing."
